[Formula for Entrepreneurial Success](https://medium.com/@ev/formula-for-entrepreneurial-success-ea0b02c504cd)

1.Work with Amazing People  
Don’t compromise on who you choose to found your company with and hire. Do not put up with ego-centric personalities or downer attitudes.

2.Take on Big Challenges  
It’s pretty simple: Hard things are valuable; easy things are not so valuable. Reaching the mountaintop is rewarding because it is hard. If it was easy, everybody would do it.

3.Focus  
Say no to most things: Features. People. Partnerships. “Coffees.” Projects. Only a few of them really matter. (Yes, it’s hard to know which.) Don’t get distracted.

4.Take Care of Yourself  
When you don’t sleep, eat crap, don’t exercise, and are living off adrenaline for too long, your performance suffers. Your decisions suffer. Your company suffers.

5.Love those Close to You  
Failure of your company is not failure in life. Failure in your relationships is.
