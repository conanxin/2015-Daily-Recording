1. I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. 我希望之前有勇气过自己的生活，而不是别人所期待的我的生活。
2. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard. 我希望之前没有那么拼命工作。
3. I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.我希望之前有勇气表达我的感受。
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. 我希望之前能多接触我的朋友。
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier. 我希望之前能让自己更快乐。

所以你应该做的：

1. Decide to live your dreams whilst you still have your health.
2. Don’t work too much. Get off the treadmill of endless work.
3. Take time to express your feelings to those you love and to those who care about you.
4. Cultivate friendships. Don’t let your friendships slip.
5. Happiness is a choice. Make the decision to be happy every day
