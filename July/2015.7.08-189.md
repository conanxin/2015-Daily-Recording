[The Top 10 Behaviors That Could Launch Your Career](http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2015/06/25/the-top-10-behaviors-that-could-launch-your-career/?utm_source=followingweekly&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20150629)

1.Be authentic.  
“Motivation comes from working on things we care about, but it also comes from working with people we care about, and in order to care about someone you have to know them. You have to know what they love and hate, what they feel–not just what they think. If you want to win hearts and minds, you have to lead with your heart as well as your mind. I don’t believe we have a professional self from Mondays through Fridays and a real self the rest of the time. That kind of division probably never worked, but in today’s world it makes even less sense … It is all professional and it is all personal, all at the very same time.”

2.Be passionate.

3.Be focused.   

4.Look forward.

5.Own it

6.Be an artist  
“Are you an artist or just following instructions?” – Seth Godin

7.Stay Persistent

8.Embrace your fears. 

9.Don’t make excuses.

10.Enjoy the moment.
