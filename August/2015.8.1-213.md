[7 Habits You Should Pick Up if You Want to Be Seen as a Leader](https://www.themuse.com/advice/7-habits-you-should-pick-up-if-you-want-to-be-seen-as-a-leader)

1.They Never Speak Too Much  
Abraham Lincoln was once quoted as saying that it’s “better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.” 

2.They’re Flexible  
Rather than coming up with an idea or strategy and adhering to it rigidly, powerful people tend to be adaptable.

3.They Don’t Argue  
Arguments can be functional, though in most cases, they waste energy that could better be spent proving your case through an action. If you voice your opinion only to be met with dissent, don’t waste time further arguing your points or trying to convince someone who has in all likelihood already made up their mind. Instead, get to work on your plan and actively demonstrate that your side of the argument is the correct one.

4.They Stay Active in the Community  
This works on multiple levels; powerful people engage with their families, engage with their colleagues, and engage with their friends and community members.

5.They Think Several Moves Ahead

6.They Time Things Carefully  
In many cases, what you do doesn’t matter nearly as much as when you do it. 

7.They Distinguish Themselves  
Powerful leaders don’t emerge unless they somehow distinguish themselves from the group in some way.
