[幸福的六个秘诀](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NzU2NDk0NA==&mid=400617854&idx=1&sn=abd86b8364bd850504e67754a4c12fc4&scene=1&srcid=1118PpV7N8QyqDJFDRmFuClw#rd)

1. Give yourself permission to be human. When we accept emotions — such as fear, sadness, or anxiety — as natural, we are more likely to overcome them. Rejecting our emotions, positive or negative, leads to frustration and unhappiness.
使自己为人。当我们接受情绪——如恐惧、悲伤或焦虑——作为自然的事情，我们更容易克服它们。拒绝我们的情绪，积极的或消极的，会导致挫折和悲伤。

2. Happiness lies at the intersection between pleasure and meaning. Whether at work or at home, the goal is to engage in activities that are both personally significant and enjoyable. When this is not feasible, make sure you have happiness boosters, moments throughout the week that provide you with both pleasure and meaning.
幸福存在于快乐和意义的交叉点。不管是工作或在家里，我们的目标是参与到对个人重要和享受的活动中。当这不可行时，要确保你有幸福的助推器，能够在一周内给你提供快乐和意义。

3. Keep in mind that happiness is mostly dependent on our state of mind, not on our status or the state of our bank account. Barring extreme circumstances, our level of well being is determined by what we choose to focus on (the full or the empty part of the glass) and by our interpretation of external events. For example, do we view failure as catastrophic, or do we see it as a learning opportunity?
注意，幸福是取决于我们的心理状态，不取决于我们的地位或我们银行的存款。除非是在极端情况下，我们的幸福水平取决于我们选择关注的地方和我们对外部事件的解释。例如，我们视失败为灾难性的，或者我们视其为学习机会？

4. Simplify! We are, generally, too busy, trying to squeeze in more and more activities into less and less time. Quantity influences quality, and we compromise on our happiness by trying to do too much.
简化！我们通常都太忙，尝试在越来越少的时间内做越来越多的事情。数量影响质量，并且我们试图做太多的事情而妥协了我们的幸福。

5. Remember the mind-body connection. What we do — or don't do — with our bodies influences our mind. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and healthy eating habits lead to both physical and mental health.
记住身心的联系。我们做什么或不做什么，身体影响头脑。经常锻炼，充足的睡眠和健康的饮食习惯会使我们的心理和生理健康。

6. Express gratitude, whenever possible. We too often take our lives for granted. Learn to appreciate and savor the wonderful things in life, from people to food, from nature to a smile.
只要有可能，表达感激之情。我们通常认为我们的生活理所当然。学着感激和享受生活中美好的事情，从人到事物，从自然到一个微笑。
