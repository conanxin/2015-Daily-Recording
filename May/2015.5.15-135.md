《爱》——罗伊·克里夫特

我爱你  
不光因为你的样子  
还因为  
和你在一起时  
我的样子  

我爱你  
不光因为你为我而做的事  
还因为  
为了你  
我能做成的事   

我爱你   
因为你能唤出  
我最真的那部分   

我爱你  
因为你穿越我心灵的旷野  
如同阳光穿透水晶般容易  
我的傻气  
我的弱点  
在你的目光里几乎不存在  
而我心里最美丽的地方  
却被你的光芒照的通亮  
别人都不曾费心走那么远   
别人都觉得寻找太麻烦  
所以没人发现过我的美丽   
所以没人到过这里

“Love”   
by Roy Croft  

I love you,   
Not only for what you are,   
But for what I am   
When I am with you.   

I love you,  
Not only for what   
You have made of yourself,   
But for what  
You are making of me.  
I love you  
For the part of me   
That you bring out;  
I love you  
For putting your hand   
Into my heaped-up heart   
And passing over  
All the foolish, weak things   
That you can’t help   
Dimly seeing there,   
And for drawing out   
Into the light   
All the beautiful belongings   
That no one else had looked   
Quite far enough to find.   

I love you because you   
Are helping me to make   
Of the lumber of my life   
Not a tavern   
But a temple;   
Out of the works   
Of my every day   
Not a reproach   
But a song.   

I love you  
Because you have done   
More than any creed   
Could have done   
To make me good   
And more than any fate   
Could have done   
To make me happy.   
You have done it   
Without a touch,   
Without a word,   
Without a sign.   
You have done it   
By being yourself.   
Perhaps that is what   
Being a friend means,   
After all.
